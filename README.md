A place to make mistakes


I am trying to make a way to get the title and other details from each video in a playlist off of youtube.

I am new to git hub so i'm not sure how to link but as I think this is public the code I ma basing my thing off of at the moment is,

"PMVamsi/pytube" and "robgibbons/youParse".
